# Checkers-game
## introduction:

This project is written after one month in 'cyber4s' program, without any prior programming knowledge. The challenge was creating a Checkers game. This challenge had consequences - those who did not write good and clear code that met all the requirements of the game - were not accepted into the course's team. After three very intense days, we submitted the project. I worked very hard to get everything done and meet the requirements in the best possible way - and I succeeded. Some time has passed since then and we learned amazing things in the team's full course. This project is my start in the programming world.
